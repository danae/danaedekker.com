  <p class="lead">I am <b>Danae Dekker</b>, a composer and technical audio designer for games and interactive media.</p>
  <p>My specialization is the integration of music and technology. I'm fascinated by musical storytelling in a fantastical and whimsical setting, which I apply in autonomous compositions, games and interactive media. Moreover I have a broad knowledge of software and coding skills to implement music and audio in any interactive project.</p>
  <p>Together with five amazing people who work in the field of game audio I form <a href="https://ocarime.com/">Ocarime</a>, a network of composers, sound designers and software developers.</p>

  <h2>Compositions</h2>

  <p>These are some autonomous compositions I made in the recent past. On the <a href="{{ document_root }}/{{ pages.projects.path }}">projects</a> page you can see more applied projects I worked on.</p>
