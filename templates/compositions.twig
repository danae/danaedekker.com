  <p class="lead">I am <b>Danae Dekker</b>, a composer and technical audio designer for games and interactive media.</p>
  <p>I specialize in musical storytelling in an often fantastical and magical setting, which I apply in autonomous compositions, games and interactive media. My musical style is a mix between ambient, orchestral and electronic elements and is inspired by the style of composers and artists such as Thomas Newman, Two Steps From Hell and Safri Duo.</p>

  <h2>Compositions</h2>

  <p>These are some autonomous compositions I made in the recent past. On the <a href="{{ document_root }}/{{ pages.projects.path }}">projects</a> page you can see more applied projects I worked on.</p>
