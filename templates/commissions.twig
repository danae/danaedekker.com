    <h2>Music commissions</h2>

    <p>Have you always wanted to have your own personal ringtone? Is your tabletop character in desperate need of a heroic theme song? Do you want to have splashing intro for your video, or an accompanying musical piece for your artwork? Or are you looking for a personal gift for a special person or occasion?</p>
    <p>I'm currently open for <b>personal music commissions</b>, which means that I compose a musical piece based on your description. In the process you will get two revisions of the composition, and when it's done, you will recieve the high quality audio of your commissioned piece. You're free to listen to, share or gift the commisioned music, as long as it's for personal use and you don't claim it as your own.</p>
    <p>If you want to order a music commission, <a href="{{ base_path_for(pages.contact) }}">send me a message</a> with your request, including the genre and length of the piece, and reference tracks. From that I'll create a musical piece that maches your description as closely as possible. Payment is due before I start working on a commission, and made in euros using a PayPal invoice or bank transfer. Please refer to the <a href="{{ commissions.tos }}">terms of service</a> for a detailed overview of the requirements of a request and the commissioning process.</p>
